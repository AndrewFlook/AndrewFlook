### [Hello there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frszEJb0aOo)

My name is Andrew Flook, as you may have guessed. I'm a 35 year old dude in Southern California, and I'm an amateur programmer that hopes to make it a career someday. I've dabbled in web programming since middle school, but never really understood much until a few years ago when I started working with Laravel.

I have one site that is currently live, built on PHP/Laravel; it's a [custom-made CMS](https://www.github.com/AndrewFlook/ttnp) for my friend's local neighborhood restaurant. I'm currently working on a full re-write of the site using what knowledge I have learned since I initially launched that site, you can track my progress on this rebuild in my [Restaurateur](https://www.github.com/AndrewFlook/restaurateur) repo.

I'm open to comments, critiques, issues, pull requests, etc; anything to help me learn and get better at becoming a full-stack developer.

Thanks for stopping by.

Cheers,

Andrew
